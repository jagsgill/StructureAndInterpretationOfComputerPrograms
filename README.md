# Approach 

I'm using SICP 2nd edition.

I decided to use [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/) with it's [sicp](https://docs.racket-lang.org/sicp-manual/) mode to work on the exercises from the book.
- Easy setup
- Leverage the DrRacket plugins/modules/package-manager
- 1 file per exercise, including solution & verification where possible using unit tests ([rackunit](https://docs.racket-lang.org/rackunit/))
